# Agility Take Home

## Running

This app was first made as a CLI and then turned into a website.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:CalebJohnHunt/agility-take-home.git

cd agility-take-home

# if you want to run the CLI:
git checkout cli # checkout cli branch
go run . Luke

# if you want to run the website
go run . --port <port> # default port: 8080
# it runs on localhost
```
